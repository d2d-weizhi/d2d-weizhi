## 👋 About

Hey everyone! If this is your first time coming to my profile, my name is Weizhi, and I'm from Singapore. For those that may not be familiar with my background, I started as a software developer back in 2005, and then discovered my own early interests and passion for UX in 2006. I began freelancing because it was the only way I could get closer to practice what we know UX to be today. But back then, we simply knew it as usability design. 

In the course of pursuing my passions, I also discovered that my front-end skills (clearly we didn't call it that back then) began to shine forth. Today, I am known for a few key achievements:

1. I become the highest earning freelancer in 2011.
2. I have worked with local SMEs, startups and even global organizations like United Nations Environmental Programme.
3. I'm a certified thought-leader in Agile UX since 2016.
4. I'm a 4x featured technical writer.
5. No. 1 Front-end Developer & UX Engineer
6. Global Top Voices in the UX Industry

## 👀 Work/Collaboration Opportunities

I continue to remain open to working opportunities and freelance gigs. Over the years, I have discovered that my skills kept getting better only because of my vast exposure to different projects and the nature of the challenges that they each presented. I will continue to collaborate and work with companies because I believe that it would allow me to stay closer to the ground.

For any consulting gigs, I'm currently charging S$150 an hour. 

I also offer referral fees to people that recommend projects to me that have been successfully completed. Any gigs that are <= S$10K, it's 5% referral fee. Anything beyond S$10K, the referral fee will go up to 10%. The largest amount of referral fee I have ever given is S$4,800.00 because the single project alone was worth S$48,000 from start to finish.

## 🧑‍💻 Building Portfolio v2.0 (WIP)

I'm currently working on a new portfolio for myself. After losing my first portfolio and all of my work back in 2018, I'm officially making a comeback. And I think that very first step of reentry for me is by being able to demonstrate and show-off my talents and skills. Instead of writing and posting about what I can do, I've discovered long ago that I have a talent for storytelling and demonstrating my skills/passions.

So that is where I will focus most of my energy and effort (outside of my top priorities).

For now though, I will begin with two new projects:

1. [FocusFlow: A Pomodoro-inspired web app](https://github.com/d2d-weizhi/focus-flow)
2. [AceIt Dashboard (WIP)](https://github.com/d2d-weizhi/aceit-dashboard)

For now, my goal remains the same, I want to focus on showcasing 3 web projects and 2 mobile projects. So, I'm starting with the above two. When it comes to the mobile app projects, my hope to to be able to build one using Flutter (cross-platform showcase), and the second one will be using native iOS (Swift）and Android (Kotlin). I will share more updates on this profile README in the weeks and months to come.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Now

I'm currently in the final stretch of my part-time post-Diploma course in UX Design & Management. So yeah, it's the final stretch. It is also why I'm taking a break from my portfolio work (updated as of 20th May). I'll still continue to work quietly and share my daily logs on the showcase project, but otherwise, I'm basically taking a step back while I focus on my top priorities.

Something else that I'm learning now is Vue.js. Not because I think it is essential for my career progression. I'm choosing to learn more about it because I believe it will allow me to understand the difference between Vue and React. It would also allow me to craft my future technical articles in a way to help Vue developers to step into React. Vue, after all, is merely a stepping stone [an accelerator] into React development.

## 📫 How to Contact Me

The easiest and fastest way to reach me today is via my email. Just reach out to [d2d.weizhi@gmail.com](mailto:d2d.weizhi@gmail.com). I usually respond within 24 hours. If there is something I'm busy with, then the maximum time I need to respond is 48 hours. I prefer not to give out my personal mobile contact because I don't usually respond well to unknown numbers trying to contact me.
