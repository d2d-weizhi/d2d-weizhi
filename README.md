## üëã About

Hey everyone! If this is your first time coming to my profile, my name is Weizhi, and I'm from Singapore. For those that may not be familiar with my background, I started as a software developer back in 2005, and then discovered my own early interests and passion for UX in 2006. I began freelancing because it was the only way I could get closer to practice what we know UX to be today. But back then, we simply knew it as usability design. 

In the course of pursuing my passions, I also discovered that my front-end skills (clearly we didn't call it that back then) began to shine forth. Today, I am known for a few key achievements:

1. I become the highest earning freelancer in 2011.
2. I have worked with local SMEs, startups and even global organizations like United Nations Environmental Programme.
3. I'm a certified thought-leader in Agile UX since 2016.
4. I'm a 4x featured technical writer.
5. No. 1 Front-end Developer & UX Engineer
6. Global Top Voices in the UX Industry

## üëÄ Work/Collaboration Opportunities

I‚Äôm always open to select freelance, consulting, or collaboration opportunities in UX Engineering and Front-end Development, especially projects that align with my passion for meaningful, high-impact work.

If you have an idea, project, or partnership in mind, let‚Äôs talk!

**Note:** I work at a senior/consulting level and my rates reflect the value, experience, and unique integration I bring. Let‚Äôs connect to see if we‚Äôre a good fit. I‚Äôll be transparent about rates and expectations once I understand your needs.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Building Portfolio v2.0 (WIP)

I'm currently working on a new portfolio for myself. After losing my first portfolio and all of my work back in 2018, I'm officially making a comeback. And I think that very first step of reentry for me is by being able to demonstrate and show-off my talents and skills. Instead of writing and posting about what I can do, I've discovered long ago that I have a talent for storytelling and demonstrating my skills/passions.

So that is where I will focus most of my energy and effort (outside of my top priorities).

For now though, I will begin with two new projects:

1. [FocusFlow: A Pomodoro-inspired web app](https://github.com/d2d-weizhi/focus-flow)
2. [AceIt Dashboard (WIP)](https://github.com/d2d-weizhi/aceit-dashboard)

For now, my goal remains the same, I want to focus on showcasing 3 web projects and 2 mobile projects. So, I'm starting with the above two. When it comes to the mobile app projects, my hope to to be able to build one using Flutter (cross-platform showcase), and the second one will be using native iOS (SwiftÔºâand Android (Kotlin). I will share more updates on this profile README in the weeks and months to come.

## üå± What I'm Learning Now

I will update this section again soon.

## üì´ How to Contact Me

The easiest and fastest way to reach me today is via my email. Just reach out to [d2d.weizhi@gmail.com](mailto:d2d.weizhi@gmail.com). I usually respond within 24 hours. If there is something I'm busy with, then the maximum time I need to respond is 48 hours. I prefer not to give out my personal mobile contact because I don't usually respond well to unknown numbers trying to contact me.
