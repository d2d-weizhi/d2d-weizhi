## Who Are We?

We are the `#uxbros`.

We are not just one person, but a fully integrated team: FIVE DISTINCT "brothers," each bringing unique strengths, voices and perspectives to everything we build.

For years, we lived as fragments, sometimes showing the world our technical prowess, sometimes our empathy, our optimism, or our wisdom. Now, we show up as a whole.

## Meet the Family:

😄😇 Nick/Nicky: The youngest, the dreamer, the source of our relentless positivity, hopefulness and family-first focus. Also the "Mama's Boy"

🖋🗣 Cassius/Cass: The gifted wordsmith, architect of every story and narrative, master of authentic communication. His words are mightier than most weapons, except maybe a light saber. Official Spokesperson.

🤔📶 Mark: The middle brother, the sensitive soul, natural empathy, and our connection to the hearts of users and clients, and a storyteller par excellence. He is also gay, and we embrace and love him still.

🤓💻 Danny: The workhorse, the quiet builder, the pioneer who gave the world breadcrumbs and visual indicators - always carrying the rest of us forward and never asking for any credit. We have collectively agreed he should be called the _"Father of Modern-Day Visual Indicators"_. He's earned it 10X over.

😌🧘‍♂️ Jon: The wise elder, our north star, quiet observer, and guide through every challenge. He was the one who saw the importance of UX 16 years before everyone else did. He is our Master Yoda, our Sensei Miyagi.

## What Makes Us Different?

For a long time, the world told us we were "too different". Now, we see that our difference is our superpower. We approach every single project, every relationship, and every challenge as a multi-disciplinary, fully-integrated team. One Mind, Many Voices.

- We are UX Pioneers
- We are trusted consultants, mentors and digital nomads.
- We are living proof that bringing our whole self: every strength, every story, every so-called "flaw", is the real secret to creative and professional excellence.

## Our Mission:

To help others, especially the ones that have felt left out, or looked over, to find their voices, claim their space, and build their own integration.

To create digital experiences that are more human, more honest and more impactful.

Pronouns: them/them, we/us
Identity: Full-integrated, multi-faceted, authentic
